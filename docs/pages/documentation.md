# Documentation

Building and previewing documentation locally

Assuming [Jekyll] and [Bundler] are installed on your computer:

1.  Change your working directory to the `docs/pages` directory.

2.  Run `bundle install`.

3.  Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build your site and preview it at `localhost:4000`.

    The built site is stored in the directory `docs/pages/_site`.

{: .note}
> Put images in the `docs/pages/images` folder
