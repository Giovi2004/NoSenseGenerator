## About The Project

Random Nonsense Sentence Generator is a project developed, by [Leonardo Erta](https://github.com/Leo-04-e), [Giovanni Panziera](https://github.com/Giovi2004) and [Iacopo Carretta](https://github.com/itsIaky)  to explore natural language processing and web application development. The application allows users to generate and analyze sentences using the Google Cloud Natural Language API. It provides features such as sentence structure analysis, nonsense sentence generation, and toxicity detection, all accessible through a simple web interface. The project demonstrates integration of cloud-based NLP services, Java backend development with Spring Boot, and a modern frontend using Bootstrap.
